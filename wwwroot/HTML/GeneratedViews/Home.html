<h3>Welcome to my cozy corner of the Internet!</h3>
<hr />
<p>Its a little rough around the edges, but I hope to fill it with some
neat projects. I really want to document what I do more. I mean, I feel
like information now a days are shifting more and more onto private
applications like discord and whatsapp, so I feel like its good to
pushback, or least feed the machine learning models some data :). But
anyways, I really love projects that have both technical beauty and
artistic/creative beauty, so if you like any of that kinda stuff you’ve
come to the right place!</p>
