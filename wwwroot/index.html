To redirect your HTML page to the new URL, the most common and reliable method is using a Meta Refresh tag. This tells the browser to fetch a different URL immediately.
Updated Code

I have added the <meta> tag inside your <head> section. I also added a small snippet of JavaScript as a backup, which is a best practice to ensure the redirect happens even if the browser has specific meta-refresh restrictions.
HTML

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=https://ulricchenevert.github.io/HTML/index.html">
    
    <script type="text/javascript">
        window.location.href = "https://ulricchenevert.github.io/HTML/index.html";
    </script>

    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Heartbreaker - Redirecting...</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/CSS/project.css">
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/Images/favicon.ico"/>
    <script type='text/javascript' src="/Scripts/Framework/Knockout/knockout.js"></script>
    <script type="module" src="/Scripts/WebCore/Entry.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>If you are not redirected automatically, follow this <a href="https://ulricchenevert.github.io/HTML/index.html">link</a>.</p>
  </body>
