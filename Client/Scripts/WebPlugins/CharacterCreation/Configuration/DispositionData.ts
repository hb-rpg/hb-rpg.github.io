    Description: "Choose one of six Ancestries — Dwarf, Elf, Halfling, Human, Ixian, or Orc — to define your character's species and cultural heritage. Your Ancestry reflects not just your biology but your upbringing, culture, and the world that shaped you before adventure called. Each Ancestry automatically populates your character with a package of features — Edges, Spells, Skills, Languages, Gear, Names, and Other — which will be reflected in the following steps as they are configured. See the rulebook for more details."

            Description: "Ixians are humanoids of extraplanar, profane origin. You are of extraplanar origin, are descended from an extraplanar immigrant, or offspring of one of these with mixed or full fiendish blood. This heritage can be expressed by black eyes, dark red or blue skin, curved black nails, cloven hooves, a tail, bony protrusions at joints, and/or horns. The emergence of Ixians coincided with the fall of the human empire and several calamitous events. Ixians are regarded with suspicion if not outright aggression by most others. It is not uncommon for an Ixian to disguise their origin unless they are belligerent or powerful enough to fend off aggressors."
